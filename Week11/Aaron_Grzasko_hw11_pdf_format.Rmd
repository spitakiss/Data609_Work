## Page 529, Question 1  
  
<p class="question">Verify that the given function pair is a solution to the first-order system.</p> 
$$x =-e^{-t},~y=e^t$$  
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=-y,~\frac {dy}{dt}=-x$$

We can verify the solution is valid by taking the derivatives of both $x$ and $y$ with respect to $t$:  
  
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(-e^{-t})=e^t = y$$  
$$\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(e^t)=e^t = x$$  
  
## Page 529 Question 6  
  
<p class="question">Find and classify the rest points of the given autonomous system</p>  

$$\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x,y)=-(y-1),~~\frac{dy}{dt}=g(x,y)=x-2 $$  
  
The only rest point, i.e. where both $f(x,y)=0$ and $g(x,y)=0$, is at $(2,1)$.  
  
The rest point is unstable as points close to this value form a circular, spiral trajectory with increasing radius as $t$ increases.  
  
Let's visualize the slope field and example trajectory near $(2,1)$, using a tool available at  
https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/nesterd/java/slopefields.html:

## Page 546 Question 1  
  
<p class="question">Apply the first and second derivative tests to the function $f(y)=y^a/e^{by}$ to show that $y=a/b$ is a unique critical point that yields the relative maximum $f(a/b)$.</p>  
  
First, find $\frac{d}{dy}(y^a/e^{by})$ using the quotient rule:  
  
$$\frac{d}{dy}(y^a/e^{by})=\frac{ay^{a-1}e^{by}-by^ae^{by}}{e^{2by}}$$  
  
$$=\frac{y^{a-1}(a-by)}{e^{by}}$$  
  
From the equation above, we determine two critical points where $\frac{d}{dy}(y^a/e^{by})=0$:  
  
$y=0$ and $y=a/b$.  
  
<br />  

Now find the second derivative:  
  
$$\frac{d}{dy}(\frac{y^{a-1}(a-by)}{e^{by}})$$  
$$=(a^2-a)y^{a-2}-aby^{a-1}$$
$$=\frac{y^{a-2}(a^2-a-aby)e^{by}-by^{a-1}(a-by)e^{by}}{e^{2by}}$$  
  

$$=\frac{y^{a-2}(a^2-a-2aby+b^2y^2)}{e^{by}}$$
<br />  
At $y = 0$, $f'(0)= 0$.  Without further investigation, we cannot determine if this point reflects a relative maximum, relative minimum, or neither.  
  
<br />  

At $y = \frac{a}{b}$:  

$$\frac{d^2}{dy^2}(a/b)=\frac{(\frac{a}{b})^{a-2}(a^2-a-2ab\frac{a}{b}+b^2\frac{a^2}{b^2})}{e^{b\frac{a}{b}}}$$  
$$=\frac{(\frac{a}{b})^{a-2}(-a)}{e^a}$$  
$$=\frac{-a^{a-1}}{b^{a-2}e^a}$$
 

The sign of $f''(\frac{a}{b})$ could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of the constants $a$ and $b$.  Without this additional information, we cannot determine if the function has a relative maximum, minimum, or neither at critical point $\frac{a}{b}$.  
  
On the other hand, if we confine $a$ and $b$ to positive real numbers, then $\frac{d^2}{dy^2}(y)$ is negative and we have a relative maximum.  
  
<p class="question">Show also that $f(y)$ approaches zero as $y$ tends to infinity</p>  
  
  
I'll provide an informal and intuitive solution:  
  
$$\lim_{y \rightarrow\infty}f(y)=\lim_{y \rightarrow\infty}y^a/e^{by}$$  
  
$$=\lim_{y \rightarrow\infty}\frac{e^{a~lny}}{e^{by}}$$  

Let's look at the exponents in the numerator and the denominator:  
  
we know that that $lny$ in the numerator grows more slowly than $y$ in the denominator as $y$ increases.  If we assume $b$ is positive, then the limit approaches zero as $y$ becomes arbitrarily large.  However, if $b$ is negative, then the denominator approaches zero (but remains positive) as $y$ tends to infinity.  In this latter case, the limit of the function approaches infinity.  
  
## Page 566 Question 1  
  
<p class="question">Use Euler's method to solve the first-order system subject to the specified initial condition.  Use the given step size $\Delta t$ and calculate the first three approximations $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3)$.  Then repeat your calculations for $\frac{\Delta t}{2}$.  Compare your approximations with the values of the given analytical solution.</p>  
  
<br />  
  
Given:  
  
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=2x+3y$$  
$$\frac{dy}{dt}=3x+2y$$  
$$x(0)=1,y(0)=1,\Delta t = \frac{1}{4}$$  
  
Provided Analytical solution:  
  
$$x(t)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}+\frac{1}{2}e^{5t},~y(t)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}+\frac{1}{2}e^{5t} $$
  
First, we'll set up the problem in R:   

```{r}
# initial conditions
x0 <- 1 
y0 <- 1
dt <- 0.25
dt_half <- dt/2
t0 = 0

# dxdt
dxdt <- function(x,y) 2*x + 3*y  

# dydt
dydt <- function(x,y) 3*x + 2*y  

# analytical solution x  
x.t <- function(t){
  0.5 * exp(-t) + 0.5*exp(5*t)
}    

# analytical solution y
y.t <- function(t){
  0.5 * exp(-t) + 0.5*exp(5*t)
}    
```  
  
Note: Euler's method employs the following recursive calculations:  
  
$$x_i=x_{i-1}+f(t_{i-1},x_{i-1},y_{i-1})\Delta t$$  
  
$$y_i=y_{i-1}+g(t_{i-1},x_{i-1},y_{i-1})\Delta t$$  
  
Let's generate the first three approximations using step size $\frac{1}{4}$.  We'll then compare the results to the analytical solutions.    
```{r}
### approximation, step size 1/4 ####

# x1,y1 
x1 <- x0 + dxdt(x0,x0)*dt  
y1 <- y0 + dydt(x0,y0)*dt  

# x2, y2
x2 <- x1 + dxdt(x1,x1)*dt  
y2 <- y1 + dydt(x1,y1)*dt  
  
# x3, y3
x3 <- x2 + dxdt(x2,x2)*dt  
y3 <- y2 + dydt(x2,y2)*dt

# ordered pair approximations, step size 1/4, saved as vector 
approx1 <- c(paste0("(",round(x1,4),",",round(y1,4),")"),
             paste0("(",round(x2,4),",",round(y2,4),")"),
             paste0("(",round(x3,4),",",round(y3,4),")"))

##### analytical results ####

# x1, y1
x1_act <- x.t(t0 + dt)
y1_act <- y.t(t0 + dt)
  
# x2, y2
x2_act <- x.t(t0 + dt*2)
y2_act <- y.t(t0 + dt*2) 

# x3, y3  
x3_act <- x.t(t0 + dt*3)
y3_act <- y.t(t0 + dt*3) 

# save actual results to vector
actual <- c(paste0("(",round(x1_act,4),",",round(y1_act,4),")"),
            paste0("(",round(x2_act,4),",",round(y2_act,4),")"),
            paste0("(",round(x3_act,4),",",round(y3_act,4),")"))
                  
# first three time steps
t <- c(0.25,0.50,0.75)

# save to df
df <- data.frame(t = t, approx=approx1, actual=actual)

# print
knitr::kable(df, align="rrr")

```  
  
<br />  

Finally, we'll generate the first three approximations using step size $\frac{1}{8}$.  Once again, we'll then compare the results to the analytical solutions.    

```{r}
## step size 1/8 ####

# x1,y1 
x1_half <- x0 + dxdt(x0,x0)*dt_half  
y1_half <- y0 + dydt(x0,y0)*dt_half  

# x2, y2
x2_half <- x1_half + dxdt(x1_half,x1_half)*dt_half  
y2_half <- y1_half + dydt(x1_half,y1_half)*dt_half  
  
# x3, y3
x3_half <- x2_half + dxdt(x2_half,x2_half)*dt_half  
y3_half <- y2_half + dydt(x2_half,y2_half)*dt_half

# ordered pair approximations, step size 1/4, saved as vector
approx2 <- c(paste0("(",round(x1_half,4),",",round(y1_half,4),")"),
             paste0("(",round(x2_half,4),",",round(y2_half,4),")"),
             paste0("(",round(x3_half,4),",",round(y3_half,4),")"))
                
##### analytical results ####

# x1, y1
x1_act_half <- x.t(t0 + dt_half)
y1_act_half <- y.t(t0 + dt_half)
  
# x2, y2
x2_act_half <- x.t(t0 + dt_half*2)
y2_act_half <- y.t(t0 + dt_half*2) 
  
# x3, y3
x3_act_half <- x.t(t0 + dt_half*3)
y3_act_half <- y.t(t0 + dt_half*3) 
  
# save analytical results to vector
actual_half <- c(paste0("(",round(x1_act_half,4),",",round(y1_act_half,4),")"),
            paste0("(",round(x2_act_half,4),",",round(y2_act_half,4),")"),
            paste0("(",round(x3_act_half,4),",",round(y3_act_half,4),")"))
                  
# first three time periods
t <- c(1/8,2/8,3/8)

# save to df
df <- data.frame(t = t, approx=approx2, actual=actual_half)

# print
